In this GitHub repository you can find the results for the course assignment for the Coursera course 'Practical Machine Learning'.

The results are summarized in the file 'PML_caret.html'.

If you want to play around with my analysis you can find the code in the file 'PML_caret.Rmd'.

If you only want to use the results or the trained models in order to evaluate further topics feel free to use the workspace 'PML_caret.RData'.
